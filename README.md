# SickAssCharacterController
Trying to make some mechanics like climbing system, slow down time archery etc. 
Using Unity's new Input System

## Climbing Branch

In this Branch we only focus on movement and parkour, it includes motion matching stuff too.
By the end of it might have a solid third person movement system atleast.

### Todo
- Complete the climbing system however it is
- This is an Experimental branch so stuff wont work well ofc
- Maybe try adding the wallrun thing etc too?
