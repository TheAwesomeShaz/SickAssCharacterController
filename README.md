# SickAssCharacterController
Trying to make some mechanics like climbing system, slow down time archery etc. 
Using Unity's new Input System

## Parkour Branch

In this Branch we only focus on movement and parkour, it includes motion matching stuff too.

### What it contains
- Walk/Jog/Sprint blendtree movement
- Climb different height obstacles with same anims
- Motion Matching (same thing as above but I wanna sound cool)
- Parkour Actions like Vault and Slide, yee that's it.
- Jump down from edge of cube
- Jump type depends on Speed, there is also a fall roll
- There is no ledge limiting, if u run of u will fall off


### Todo
- Add Proper Ground/Obstacles layer later
- Add a ladder climb to this branch
- Add climbing system only if it is stable
- Try Adding wallrun if feeling brave
